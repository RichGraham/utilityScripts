This creates the following files
- .bashprofile
- .emacs
- shell commands diskUse, oldHistory and search
- a global .gitignore file
- xmgrace template

====Building====
Run ./makeAll.sh to install by making soft-links
The .bashprofile needs to be copied by hand and should only be used for machines without a profile

====Scripts====
* timeDiff.sh: seems to be broken on a Mac :(

* ipythToPython.sh: converts an iPython notebook into a python script
